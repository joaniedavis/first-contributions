# What is a commit message?

A commit message is the text that is associated with your commit. It should outline the general intent of the changes made in that commit. 

# Why is it important to write good commit messages?

Commit messages give additional context to changes that are made in the code base. They can justify a deletion, or better explain a refactoring decision. It is unlikely that you will be committing code to a project that no one else will ever look at, and these commit messages will help someone else understand what you've done. Even if you are working on the project on your own, going back through your own commit messages can be extremely helpful to regain any context for your own code that you might have lost.
